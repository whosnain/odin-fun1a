Recipe Project from the Odin Project HTML Foundations

In addition to the coding learnt in the HTML Foundations, I added knowledge of centering, underlining and italics
Through looking over the internet, I learnt how to add padding and allowing for links to appear on the same line
Also understanding a bit of basic CSS prior to learning it later in the course.
